"""Regression tests for E5 — wire PolyphonicRecallEngine under feature flag.

Pre-E5: `PolyphonicRecallEngine` (mnemosyne/core/polyphonic_recall.py)
existed as a complete 4-voice + RRF + diversity-rerank + budget-aware
context-assembly implementation, but it was dead code — no production
caller imported it. Commit 9f96ded's "polyphonic recall" was actually
inline graph_bonus + fact_bonus added to BeamMemory's linear scorer
(beam.py:2101-2156), not the engine.

Post-E5:
  - `MNEMOSYNE_POLYPHONIC_RECALL=1` activates the polyphonic engine
    inside `BeamMemory.recall()`
  - Default (flag unset or "0"): existing linear scorer runs unchanged —
    production behavior preserved
  - Flag ON: engine produces ranked candidates via RRF fusion across 4
    voices (vector + graph + fact + temporal), diversity-reranks them,
    and assembles context within budget. The inline graph_bonus and
    fact_bonus terms in the linear scorer are bypassed (engine handles
    those itself).
  - Per-result `voice_scores` field carries provenance — operators can
    see WHICH voices contributed to a given ranking.
  - Engine reuses BeamMemory's shared sqlite connection rather than
    spawning 4+ new connections per recall call.

This unblocks the experiment's "strongest available recall layer" —
all arms run with flag=ON to test against the polyphonic engine
instead of the inline bonus shortcut.
